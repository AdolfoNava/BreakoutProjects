Fixes/Changes (Based on MonogameBoring changes):
Controls: 
Restart = Spacebar
left = left arrow
right = right arrow
up = launch ball
IF I DIDN'T mention a particular project file it means that I didn't edit them from the MonogameBoring project folder predecessor
Game1.cs:
- Rearranged the lines when the game components get implemented
- Made a complete reset function by pressing the space bar reverts everything back to the start of the game
Ball.cs:
- Increase the speed of the ball by 2 applied when the ball bounces to the paddle and blocks
- Fixed lives being lost when the ball hits the bottom of the screen
- Resets the ball and Paddle on when the live should be lost
Paddle.cs:
- Increased the starting speed of the paddle to 250 feels better in my opinion
- Increase the paddle speed when the ball gets close to the speed of the paddle by 50 each time.
- OnPaddleStart state is set the speed reset back to 200 on "death"
- Fixed the bouncing of the ball to be more like traditional breakout games
(i.e. ball hitting left side of the paddle makes the ball move to the left and same on the other side)
ScoreManager.cs: 
- Added a NextLevel method to increase the level which would go into other levels
- changed the SetupNewGame from being a private method to public to see it when we need to restart the game
BlockManager.cs:
- Changed the CreateBlockArrayByWidthAndHeight to add another in method variable for setting the level's block
- Changed the LoadLevel method from protected to public and made a switch-case system calling for ScoreManager.Level to make a new level to make new calls to the
 CreateBlockArrayByWidthAndHeight which would make more levels (basic levels but new ones nonetheless)
- Add a new method to help make a new game start called ClearAllBlocksOnScreen which does exactly what it says to cleanup the screen for restarts
- Trigger to increase the ball speed if the ball contact with the block
- Automatically go into the next level when there are no more blocks to collide and resets the ball to the paddle
Block.cs:
- Changed the BlockState enum to include the new blocks I added into the game
(earth,red, and yellow)
- Added to an int to the constructor so that the game can change the blocks for the level with the blockmanager
MonogameBlock.cs:
- Made new blocks into the game that become more durable each level you head into
- Added the new enums to the switch case from the BlockState that are connected to the new blocks to the game
